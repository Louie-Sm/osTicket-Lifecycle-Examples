Here we have a user "Karen" who is creating a ticket, the help topic is "Business Critical Outage" because customers are reporting that they cannot access mobile banking and are recieving an error.

Agents will be able to see live tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers will be able to assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assigning proper SLAs.

For Karens ticket we are setting the priority level of the ticket to Sev-A Emergency since we are dealing with an issue that can effect an entire customer facing portion of the business. We assign it to an agent and we have changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top level technician and we set the department to System Administrators. In some ticketing system customers can set their own SLA plans.

</p>
From there we can go ahead and solve the ticket and then resolve it as well.

We can then look at the resolved tickets in our 'Closed' tickets tab.
